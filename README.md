# Displacement to strain calculation

This program generates strain maps from displacement (motion) maps, with the goal of processing the ML model output to show strain levels across material images rather than motion. The input maps are generated by the motion model as 2D arrays of <x,y> motion at each point in the material image, and the program uses VSG strain calculation to create a 2D array of <XX,YY,XY> strain values.

# Instructions:

1. Download strain_calc.exe from releases

2. Run using command line:

```
./strain_calc.exe <disp file/folder path> <subset size> [-npy/jpg] [-o <output_dir>]
```

3. Program will output strain in a txt file by default, or you can specify -npy or -jpg to output in other formats.

> Note: displacement.txt file must be formatted in the following fashion:

```
<pixelX> <pixelY> <motionX> <motionY>

```
And must increment pixelY values before pixelX values

Example:

```
0 0 1.343 2.555
0 1 5.333 2.344
...
1 0 4.323 3.234
1 1 1.123 5.343 
...
```

> Note: When using the -npy flag, the displacement file must be a .npy file. The values should be double precision and in the shape (rows, cols, 2).



## Building

### Dependencies

Eigen is used for matrix operations. It can be downloaded from the [Eigen website](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php).
Put the Eigen folder in the dependencies folder at `dependencies/Eigen/`.

OpenCV is required for strain pre/post processing. It can be downloaded from [OpenCV website](https://opencv.org/releases/).
**After downloading, you must:**

1. Add the path to opencv/build on your computer to your PATH environment variable

2. In opencv/build/x64/vc16/bin, copy all dll and pdb files to the same folder as your strain_calc.exe

### Building

To build the program, run the following command:

```bash
make
```

This will create a `strain_calc` executable in the current directory.
